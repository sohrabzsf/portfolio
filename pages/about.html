        Hi there! My name is <strong>Sohrab</strong>, and I am a junior
        <strong>front-end developer</strong> with a passion for creating dynamic
        and engaging web applications. With working experience in
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>,
        <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>Tailwind</strong>, <strong>Sass</strong>,
        <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>Git</strong>, and
        <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong>, I am confident in my ability to
        build visually stunning and user-friendly websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have consistently pushed myself to learn new technologies and improve
        my skills. I endeavor and take pride in writing clean, efficient, and
        maintainable code and ensuring that my projects are optimized for speed
        and performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaboration is important to me, and I am comfortable working in a team
        environment. Using Git has taught me the importance of version control
        and efficient communication, which are essential skills for any
        successful project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am excited about the prospect of joining a team that shares my passion
        for creating top-notch web applications. As a quick learner and
        dedicated team player, I am confident that I will be a valuable asset to
        any organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. Have a
        good time.
